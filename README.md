## Audio Visualizer

This project is created using P5.js to visualize music. It's created for fun, and more features will be added soon ^\_^.

Note: You need to have a https localhost, with https in order to run the code, as p5.sound.js requires it.

### Installing http-server

To install and use http-server, go to: [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

### Using http-server to run the project

1. Go to the directory you have cloned this project in Command Prompt.
2. Type in http-server -S, and press enter.
3. Note that http-server -S enables https server, which allows the p5.js.sound library to run smoothly. Normally you will need to configure cert.pem and key.pem, but since it is provided in the project, you can use it to work fine.
4. To learn about configuring cert.pem and key.pem, go to : [SSL Certificates](https://galeracluster.com/library/documentation/ssl-cert.html)
5. Copy one of the URL and paste in your browser window.
6. Click on empty-example, and the JS script should start running.
7. Scroll down, and click on "Play" button. Music should start playing, and visual animation should show :) Enjoy
